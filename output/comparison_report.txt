AI.SEE ASSESSMENT - MODEL COMPARISON REPORT
============================================================

OVERVIEW:
--------------------
This report compares the performance and results of PyTorch and ONNX models
for YOLO object detection on the same input image.

SIMILARITY METRICS:
--------------------
Detection match rate: 100.00%
Average confidence difference: 0.0049
PyTorch detections: 5
ONNX detections: 5

INTERPRETATION:
--------------------
✅ Excellent consistency between models
✅ Very similar confidence scores

CONCLUSION:
--------------------
Both PyTorch and ONNX models successfully detected objects in the image.
The conversion process maintained the model's detection capabilities.
Minor differences in bounding box coordinates and confidence scores
are expected due to numerical precision differences between frameworks.
